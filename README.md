# PowerBi-Project-Credit-Risk-Analysis
## ðŸ“Š  Credit Risk Analysis Dashboard
## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing a Credit Risk Dataset to uncover patterns related to loan defaults, income levels, interest rates, loan amounts, and customer demographics.
The objective is to help financial institutions understand:

*  Which factors influence loan defaults
*   How income levels and loan sizes impact repayment
*   The overall distribution of credit risks across customer segments
*   The analysis was visualized in a Credit Risk Dashboard created using Power BI, making it easier to interpret the data and generate actionable insights.

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset

The dataset contains loan application and repayment information, including:

* Income Category (Low, Middle, High)
* Loan Amount & Loan Grade
* Default History (Yes/No)
* Average Interest Rate
* Employee Length
* Loan Purpose (Intent) e.g., Medical, Education, Personal, Venture
* Debt Burden by Loan Size

## ðŸ›  Tools & Technologies

* Power BI â€“ for building the interactive dashboard
* SQL â€“ for cleaning and preparing raw data
* DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) â€“ for creating measures and KPIs

## ðŸ”Ž Methodology

### Data Cleaning & Preparation

* Handled missing values and standardized categories
*  Converted numerical fields into bins (e.g., Income Level, Loan Size)
* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
* Analyzed loan intent vs. default rates
* Segmented borrowers by income and loan grades
* Dashboard Development
* Created KPIs (Average Income, Default Rate, Loan Amounts)
* Designed visuals for Loan Status, Income Levels, Debt Burden, and Loan Grades
* Applied slicers for interactivity

## ðŸ“ˆ Key Insights

* Default Rate: 18% of loans defaulted, signaling notable credit risk.
* Loan Purpose: Medical and debt consolidation loans were most common.
* Income Levels: Middle-income borrowers took the largest share of loans.
* Debt Burden: Borrowers with very high loan sizes had the highest repayment challenges.
* Loan Grades: High-risk grades accounted for larger loan amounts compared to low-risk grades.
